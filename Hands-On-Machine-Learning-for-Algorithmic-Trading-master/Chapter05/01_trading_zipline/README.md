## Trading with zipline

The notebook [alpha_factor_zipline_with_trades](alpha_factor_zipline_with_trades.ipynb) demonstrates how to run a backtest using the MeanReversionFactor develop in the last chapter on [Alpha Factor Researc](../../04_alpha_factor_research).


Run the following from the command line to create a conda environment with zipline and pyfolio:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml

```
This assumes you have [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed.
