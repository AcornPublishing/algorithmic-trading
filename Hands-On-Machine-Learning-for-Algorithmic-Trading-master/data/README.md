# Data Sources used in the book

We will use freely available historical data from market, fundamental and alternative sources. Chapter 2, Market and Fundamental Data and Chapter 3, Alternative Data for Finance  cover characteristics and access to these data sources and introduce key providers that we will use throughout the book. 

A few sample data sources that we will source and work with include, but are not limited to:
- NASDAQ ITCH order book data
- Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) SEC filings
- Earnings call transcripts from Seeking Alpha
- Quandl daily prices and other data points for over 3,000 US stocks
- Various macro fundamental data from the Federal Reserve and others
- Large Yelp business reviews and Twitter datasets

## How to source the Data

The notebook [create_datasets](create_datasets.ipynb) contains information on downloading the Quandl Wiki stock prices and a few other sources that we use throughout the book. 

Instructions to obtain data sources for specific applications are provided in the relevant directories and notebooks of this repository.
